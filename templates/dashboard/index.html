  <p class="text">
    The Inventory Management System Web Application, built with Django for the
    backend and Bootstrap for the frontend, streamlines inventory tracking and
    order management. Key features include user roles, allowing admins full
    control while staff have limited access based on permissions. Admins can
    manage products by adding, updating, and deleting them, with each product
    having attributes like name, category, model number, and stock quantity. The
    system supports order management for both admins and staff, detailing
    product, category, model number, ordered quantity, date, and status.
    Superusers automatically get order issuance permissions, while regular staff
    can have these permissions granted by admins. Additional features include
    search and filter options, Excel export functionality, important
    notifications and alerts, and secure authentication to ensure user data
    protection.

  <h4 class="heading">User Roles and Permissions</h4>
  <p class="text">
    The system categorizes users into admins and staff. Admins have comprehensive control over the system, while staff access is limited to specific permissions. This hierarchical structure ensures that only authorized personnel can make critical changes, enhancing security and accountability.
  </p>
  <h4 class="heading">Product Management</h4>
  <p class="text">
    Admins can efficiently manage the product catalog. The system allows adding new products, updating existing ones, and deleting outdated or unnecessary items. Each product entry includes essential details such as the product name, category, model number, and current stock levels.
  </p>
  <h4 class="heading">Order Management</h4>
  <p class="text">
    Both admins and staff can place and track orders. The order management feature includes detailed information about each order, such as the product, category, model number, ordered quantity, order date, and current status. This feature ensures transparency and efficient handling of inventory.
  </p>
  <h4 class="heading">Additional Features</h4>
  <p class="text">
    The application includes advanced search and filter options, allowing users to quickly find specific products or orders. The Excel export functionality enables users to download order details for offline use or reporting purposes. Important notifications and alerts keep users informed about critical updates or low stock levels. The secure authentication mechanism ensures that all user data is protected and accessible only to authorized users.
